# Web Development Project 2 - *Labubu Learning*

Submitted by: **Kelly Chan**

This web app: **Labubu Learning lets you test how well you know Labubu through a set of fun, flip-able flashcards. Each card has a question on the front and the answer (sometimes with a photo!) on the back. It's a quick and playful way to learn more about these fun little characters.**

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] **The app displays the title of the card set, a short description, and the total number of cards**
  - [X] Title of card set is displayed 
  - [X] A short description of the card set is displayed 
  - [X] A list of card pairs is created
  - [X] The total number of cards in the set is displayed 
  - [X] Card set is represented as a list of card pairs (an array of dictionaries where each dictionary contains the question and answer is perfectly fine)
- [X] **A single card at a time is displayed**
  - [X] Only one half of the information pair is displayed at a time
- [X] **Clicking on the card flips the card over, showing the corresponding component of the information pair**
  - [X] Clicking on a card flips it over, showing the back with corresponding information 
  - [X] Clicking on a flipped card again flips it back, showing the front
- [X] **Clicking on the next button displays a random new card**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [X] Cards contain images in addition to or in place of text
  - [X] Some or all cards have images in place of or in addition to text

## Notes

One challenge I faced was getting the cards to flip smoothly between the question and answer sides. It took a bit of trial and error (and research!) to make sure the flipping worked without glitches. Another thing was adding difficulty categories and changing the card colors based on those levels. I had to update the data and figure out how to apply different styles depending on the difficulty. It wasnâ€™t always easy, but it helped me learn a lot about managing state and styling in React.
